# How to Give Constructive Feedback That Actually Empowers Others

<https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-give-constructive-feedback-that-actually-changes/454567>

## Focus on behavior, not personality

For example, say
üëç "The last report had many typos and formatting errors"
rather than
üëé "Your work is usually sloppy."

## Preserve the relationship

Start by acknowledging strengths and good intentions.

Explain the purpose behind your comments. As I mentioned earlier, focus on the work, not the person.

### 1. Specificity

üëé "You did a great job"

üëç "You handled that difficult client conversation very skillfully by focusing on shared interests,"

### 2. Timeliness

Aim to provide feedback within a day or two of an event or interaction.

### 3. Relevance

Your feedback should relate directly to the person's work responsibilities and goals.

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid getting personal or venturing into areas beyond your purview.

### 4. Empathy

Start by acknowledging their good intentions, then explain how their approach could be refined.

## Highlight specific examples

Examples make the feedback feel real and highlight areas for improvement.

## Suggest alternative behaviors

Don't just point out what someone did wrong - also propose positive alternatives they could try next time.

## Be Solution-Focused

Phrases like "Next time, try .." or "In the future, it would be better to ... " help make the feedback about moving forward productively.

## Use "I" statements and listen actively

For example, üëç"I felt the introduction lost people" instead of üëé "You lost people with that introduction."

## Follow up on progress
