# Startup Engineering Hiring Anti-Patterns
<https://blog.southparkcommons.com/startup-engineering-hiring-anti-patterns/>

The most important traps to avoid when hiring startup engineers.

## Hiring for a particular tool-chain or framework

Great engineers all have the capability to learn new languages and frameworks easily.

## Hiring Specialists

There are exceptions, but for the most part startups don’t need deep specialists.

## Comfort in the False Negative Zone

This is pretty counter to regular Silicon Valley advice, but a startup should push itself to find real deal-breakers and not get comfortable with False Negatives.

## A lack of funnel discipline

But hope is not a real strategy.

## Slow to Hire, Slow to Fire

As a startup, you need to be comfortable taking risks on hires but also parting ways if it isn’t working out after 2–3 months.
