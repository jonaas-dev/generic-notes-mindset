High quality software is cheaper to produce. Summing all of this up:

- Neglecting internal quality leads to rapid build up of cruft
- This cruft slows down feature development
- Even a great team produces cruft, but by keeping internal quality high, is able to keep it under control
- High internal quality keeps cruft to a minimum, allowing a team to add features with less effort, time, and cost.
