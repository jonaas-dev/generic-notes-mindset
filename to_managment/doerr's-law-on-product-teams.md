We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.\
John Doerr


The surface interpretation is something like this: “Missionaries believe in what they’re doing, in their mission. Mercenaries are just here for the paycheck.”

## Who cares

That’s still true. I still want that, but increasingly, I think that’s just the baseline. A great product team needs more than understanding, more than caring. A great product team needs empowerment.

## Missionaries Say No

The framing of a problem is often far more essential than its solution.\
Albert Einstein

Yes, yes, missionaries are true believers who care and all that, but what got my attention is that first line: Mercenaries build whatever they’re told to build.

**But missionaries feel empowered to say no**. They understand the customers and problems deeply enough and are so engaged with the vision of the product that they will fight against changes that could harm the product or harm the user.

## Voice of Authority

It is a core value of our culture, and we tell our engineers and designers this all the time:

- We are not order-takers.
- We are not robots where requirements go in one side and deliverables come out the other.
- If we are not pushing back and saying no, we are doing a disservice to our clients.

And this brings us to a truism of modern workplaces: **Consultants are often more empowered than internal employees**.

## Creating Missionaries

- Involve delivery leads as early as possible
- Ask for feedback & alternatives
- Explain intent 
- Minimize hops between user feedback and execution team ... I think there is something magical about reading the actual words of the user, rather than a summary.

And that’s ultimately the deep truth of Doerr’s Law: **Your product is a reflection of your team**.
