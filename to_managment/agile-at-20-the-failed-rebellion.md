# Agile at 20: The Failed Rebellion

## Whence The manifesto

They were still slingin’ code* and working with their stakeholders to solve problems. This is important.

The other point is that the Agile Manifesto wasn’t created in a vacuum. Many of these people already had a methodology they had created and/or were proselytizing.

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

in 2001, these ideas were wildly radical.

## A new Hope

Agility & PMI

Scrum Masters had almost no authority, no votes on issues. They were servant leaders, helping shield and unblock the team but not managing the team. XP was similar. If I recall correctly, XP originally had trackers and coaches, which had a similar facilitating, supportive vibe.

Scrum was invented to function in hostile environments. It’s a contract between hard-pushing managers and developers needing time to think and explore.

## The Empire Strikes Back
...

Unfortunately, like many revolutions, the history of Agile didn’t unfold how the founders envisioned.

- It turns out that `prioritizing individuals and interactions` is a hard concept to sell. It’s much easier to sell processes and tools.
- It turns out that `working software` is harder to produce than unrealistic plans and reams of documentation.
- It turns out that `collaborating with customers` requires trust and vulnerability, not always present in a business setting.
- It turns out that `responding to change` often gets outweighed by executives wanting to feel in control and still legitimately needing to make long-term plans for their businesses.

:warning: It turns out that Agile done poorly often feels like chaos.

## "Return of the" Rogue One?

It’s been overrun with tool vendors and process consultants and experts making promises that can never be delivered. This is how we’ve ended up with SAFe and Scaled Scrum and all of the other enterprise Agile flavors. These frameworks weren’t created with malicious intent, and they probably even have some value in the right context. But I wouldn’t call them Agile. Trying to scale a methodology that focuses on individuals and interactions will inevitably lead to problems – and erode the original value of the methodology.

## Retro

Jeffries in the article mentioned above, says, “However, the values and principles of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development still offer the best way I know to build software, and based on my long and varied experience, I’d follow those values and principles no matter what method the larger organization used.”

It’s not hip or cool to talk about Agile now. Agile is boring. Everybody does Agile, right? Now is the perfect time to reflect on the last 20 years and ask ourselves a few questions:

- What went right?
- What went wrong?
- What do we want to do differently next time?
