# The D.E.N.N.I.S. system: Résumé tips for Senior Devs

Font: https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/p/the-dennis-system-cvs-tips-for-senior

## D: Drive Initiatives

**In your last company, what wouldn’t have happened without you?**
Some examples:

- Drove the adoption of an RFC process that’s now used for all new system designs and changes to public interfaces
- Introduced security check-ins into our releases to ensure our application was up-to-date with OWASP best practices
- Set up our first platform team - focused on developing and maintaining internal libraries, SDKs, and build processes

## E: Embrace LaTeX

Using LaTeX for your résumé sends a subtle but clear message: you love software engineering so much that you've coded your CV.

## N: Name Recognition

**If you aren’t fortunate enough to have a big name on your work experience**, don’t despair - you could, for instance, contribute to popular open-source libraries and point us to that.

Another cognitive bias you could capitalise on is **social proof** - it will generate a positive impression with the hiring manager if you have lots of Github stars, a high StackOverflow reputation, or, of course…

## N: No More Lists

The vast majority of CVs I see contain a section listing the platforms, frameworks, and libraries you’re familiar with. Unfortunately, all applicants for, say, an Android or iOS role generally have the exact same list.

The key here is; you want to **differentiate** yourself through your unique skills.

## I - Impact is King
If you can show you had ownership over a critical project, it tells me “your company trusted you to deliver” - it’s a strong signal that you’re capable.

## S - Short Stints are Dangerous

Several studies show that new employees might take many months to become fully productive.

If you’ve worked more than 4 jobs in the last 4 years, you’re in the danger zone. Many companies will discard a CV quickly if we don’t think you’ll stick around until next year.
