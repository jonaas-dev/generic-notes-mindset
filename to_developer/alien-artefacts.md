# Alien artefacts

Font: <https://www.brautaset.org/posts/alien-artefacts.html>

The purpose of this blog post is to introduce the concept of alien artefacts1, a subcategory of legacy code. **I use the term to describe particularly complicated and important pieces of software written by very smart engineers that are no longer working for the companyâ€”and thus not available to support it**. The software works really well for what it was designed to do, but it is highly resistant to change.

## Help! I have an alien artefact: what can I do?

- **Understand the system**: Invest time in reviewing the code and any available documentation, and try to identify the most critical parts of the system.
- **Develop a comprehensive characterisation test suite**: This is essential to ensure that changes made to the alien artefact do not introduce bugs or unintended consequences.
- **Prioritize changes carefully**: Focus on changes that are necessary to maintain the system's functionality, rather than on non-essential cosmetic changes.

Finally, if you decide to attempt to replace your alien artefact, you may find the **strangler fig pattern** useful.

## How do I avoid my team creating an alien artefact in the first place?

- **Include junior and/or generalist engineers on the team**; avoid teams staffed entirely with specialised experts with deep domain knowledge.
- **Prioritise documentation and knowledge transfer**, and invest in ongoing development to ensure the system stays adaptable to changing business needs.
- **Use standardised coding practices** and avoid using overly esoteric languages or techniques.
