# Promotion interview tips for tech: How to sell your value

Font: <https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/learning-and-development/promotion-interview-tips-tech?exp=3>

This is called **the Spotlight effect**, the psychological phenomenon by which “people tend to believe they are being noticed more than they really are.” Research has empirically shown drastically overestimating your effect on others is very common.

## An uncomfortable truth: if they don’t know, it didn’t happen

So what’s the solution? You’ve got to make the noise for the tree, so to speak.

## Your value needs to actually be communicated (Spoiler: by you!)

## Why your boss needs to understand your value, not just hear it

## How to sell your value for your promotion interview

### 1. Tell them how your actions have had a concrete impact

### 2. Find out what accomplishments would amaze them by asking the right questions

If you don’t address your **negative feedback**, you’ll forever be limited in your potential, because you’ll be ignoring the things that are holding them back from saying yes to that promotion you want.

### 3. Let them know how your upskilling has played a part in this

Or maybe you did adopt something you learned about, and this led to a business improvement!  Whatever the case may be, **tie your learning back to business value**.

### 4. Your 1-on-1 meetings are a huge promotion opportunity

If you’re going into your 1-on-1 meetings and just giving your boss a boring status update every week or month or whatever, then you’re missing out on a HUGE opportunity to guide your situation to a promotion.

## Conclusion: Communicate your value consciously and constantly
