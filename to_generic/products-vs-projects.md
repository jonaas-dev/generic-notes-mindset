# Product vs project

Font: <https://friendshipcastle.zip/blog/product-vs-project>

## Products and projects

Running a Mastodon server for a community is a project, but Twitter as a product is there and you can create an account in less than an hour. Unless you really know what you are doing, it's inconceiveable that some random person could really figure out all the technology and maintenance schedules needed to set up a Mastodon server.

Fun fact: this is the same basic friction as the "protocols vs platforms" schtick that people were on about a while ago. Protocols require work to adapt them to existing molds. Platforms and products that let you build things on top of them. Compare IRC and Discord. IRC is a protocol that's been around about as long as I've been alive, and it's historically been used by open source projects all across the world to coordinate projects that quite literally keep a large amount of society together.

I can't reply to a Linux Kernel Mailing List thread from my iPhone but I sure as hell can comment on a GitHub thread from the same device!

## Why can't they just take up a project?

I guess the real consequence of relying on these commercial platforms is that the floor can and will fall out from under you in a moment's notice. Skype went to shit without much warning. Twitter did too. Discord will next. It's not a matter of if, but when with these products.

## The path forward

I think the real solution to the protocol vs project problem is ultimately going to come down to communities banding together to create services to meet the needs of their members. Communities are what really drive society forward, not individuals.

Many people take this product vs project dichotomy to be made better by "personal responsibility" or something along that line, but honestly I think that having things like social media platforms being run by communities is a fundamental strength, not a weakness. Content moderation and server administration are fundamentally separate actions and things benefit from separate people having those responsibilities. The main problem is that a lot of these skills that were essential to early internet communities are locked away and relegated to experts that are paid too much to want to do this shit on their offtime. Can't blame them.

My therapist has told me that I really shouldn't be so conspiratorial-minded but goddamn this entire thing looks like there is some kind of conspiracy to make building communities harder and harder. Many online communities today barely resemble the communities that our parents and grandparents grew up with. Everything is so alienating and small.

This entire situation sucks and I don't know what to do about it. One of the main reasons I made my blog on my own domain hosted via fly.io is because I wanted to see how hard it would be to use Fresh to remake my blog in my image. Turns out it wasn't hard for me, but I'm an expert in backend software development and I have opinions about this shit.

I really wish I had answers here. I don't. However I think it's important for us all to really realize that projects and products are vastly different things. More than likely, you work on a product at your dayjob and work on projects on your offtime.
