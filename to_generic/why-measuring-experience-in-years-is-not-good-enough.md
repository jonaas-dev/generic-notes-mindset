# Why measuring experience in years is not good enough

Font: <https://dev.to/bolshchikov/why-measuring-experience-in-years-is-not-good-enough-1j8i>

## Part 1. The definition

Simply, experience is gained from direct observation and/or participation. Therefore, the more we encounter different types of problems and their solutions, the more our experience grows.

## Part 2. Real-life

By dividing work into repetitive tasks, the overall business is efficient, but it may hinder attempts to gain broader experience.

Solving new problems and implementing innovative features can be extremely rewarding and stimulate our intellect.

:warning: So while experience measured in time may be growing, experience measured in intellectual growth may have stalled.

## Part 3. The valid alternative

True experience comes from solving different types of problems in a variety of ways.

## Part 4. The practical way

to categorize the problems of software engineering would be in the following way, in order of complexity:

- Investigating and solving a bug
- Implementing a feature within given specifications
- Designing and implementing a feature according to a product specification
- Architecting the solution across different boundaries (e.g. front-end, back-end, devops)

:warning: I have found that the majority of full-stack developers have experience working with the first and second categories above, while the best candidates have experience in three or more of the categories.

## Part 5. Conclusion

If you are looking to optimize your professional growth, **then seeking out work environments with fast-growth** rates can help give you the space to gain a wider diversity of experience.
