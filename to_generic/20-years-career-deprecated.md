# My 20 Year Career is Technical Debt or Deprecated
<https://blog.visionarycto.com/p/my-20-year-career-is-technical-debt>

## I was “Basic” at first…

Visual Basic, ASP, IE6, and Netscape are all long-forgotten technologies. As Strong Bad would say back then, “delorted!”

## Old languages: Perl, Delphi, Fortran, FoxPro, ColdFusion

Programming languages come and go. Developers don’t want jobs learning skills that aren’t in demand. It is always a balance of supply vs demand! Developers **jump ship quickly** and always want the hot new thing on their resume.

## What happened to ActiveX, Java Applets, Flash, and Silverlight?

...

## My first mobile app

I built a mobile app in 2004. It’s hard to remember, but the iPhone and Android didn’t exist then. I wrote an application for Compaq PDAs for tracking inventory for car dealers. It was written in C# for the .NET Compact Framework to run on Windows CE.

## You better be Swift

I would argue that any apps written in Objective C are probably technical debt now.

## WebForms

...

## MVC is king! (for a while)

Fast forward to today, and **MVC has since fallen out of fashion**. Everything is now done in React, Angular, Vue, and other frameworks.

Do you remember any of these frameworks? Knockout, Ember, Aurelia, Meteor, Backbone, Handlebars

If you used any of them, I bet all that code is now considered technical debt and has fallen out of favor. The first generation of front-end frameworks lost to React and Angular.

## Angular JS

...

## The old dirty SOAP & WCF

SOAP and WCF are two things I don’t miss. Microsoft decided to no longer support WCF in .NET Core. **Things like REST, gRPC, and GraphQL are now preferred**. Although, a community project eventually made CoreWCF to keep it going.

## Major language versions

Another common problem is major programming language version changes. Be it Ruby, PHP, .NET, or others. They commonly require a bunch of code changes or even rewrites.

## Stuck on an old external dependency

One of the biggest challenges we had at Stackify was getting stuck on an old version of Elasticsearch.

## Open source alternative retired my code

...

## All code rots or gets replaced

...

## The reality of technical debt

People are always worried about minimizing technical debt when doing new projects. I understand that. There is a balance between getting things to work and trying to make them perfect.

However, **nothing is technical debt because it isn’t perfect**. There is no such thing as perfect. Over time what was perfect today won’t be perfect in the future. Learn to live with less than perfect.

The other side of technical debt is how everything slowly rots away over time. It either has significant issues with upgrading to the latest versions, or the technology ultimately falls out of favor because of newer ways to do things. Good luck hiring people for old tech stacks.

Everything eventually becomes tech debt, or the projects get sunsetted. If you are lucky, your code survives long enough to be technical debt to someone else.

**Given enough time, all your code will get deleted**.
