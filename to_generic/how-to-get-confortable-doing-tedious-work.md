# How to get comfortable with, and even enjoy, doing tedious work

https://www.fastcompany.com/90894735/how-to-get-comfortable-with-and-even-enjoy-doing-tedious-work


## 1. REMOVE ALL DISTRACTIONS

Set up a designated space for productivity, wherever that may be. Make sure to remove every temptation that could pull you away from the task at hand.

## 2. COMMIT DEDICATED TIME TO TOIL EVERY SINGLE DAY

designate specific times throughout the day for the tedious tasks that are necessary to keep your business, career, or life afloat.

## 3. WATCH FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT

For this reason, it’s imperative to recognize early signs of burnout—exhaustion, fatigue, loss of interest, withdrawal from support networks—and understand that they are an indication that there might be a better, or more efficient, way to do what you’re doing.

⚠️ It’s important to remember that doing tedious work is a skill and, like any skill, you will improve over time.
