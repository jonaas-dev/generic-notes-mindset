# How to Reduce Stress and Overcome Anxiety as a Software Developer

Font: <https://andreizgirvaci.com/blog/how-to-reduce-stress-and-overcome-anxiety-as-a-software-developer>

I can only code no more than 2 hours a day, laying in my bed and with a video playing in the background so I donâ€™t feel lonely!

## How did I get there?

- Unrealistic deadlines and underpaid work.
- Having FOMO(fear of missing out) and chasing the best framework/language/practices/design, etc.
- Being a perfectionist, trying to write the perfect code and spending way too much time on other unimportant things!
- Constantly worry about my job and if I will have enough money to live by next month.
- Disrupted sleep patterns due to irregular work schedules and late-night work.
- Neglecting to spend time on other important things like family, friends and hobbies.
- Not being aware of the signs of anxiety and not knowing how to prevent/deal with stress, burnout, loneliness, anger and other emotions I was dealing with at the time.

## My life was about to change

I did meditations, yoga, therapy, affirmations, exercising, read psychology books, began spirituality practices, went on a few silent retreats, reframed past traumas and everything in between you can think of.

## I realized I was not alone

## How to overcome anxiety?

So, I would recommend starting to incorporate small things that don't take too much effort and time. These are some things that helped me that I recommend:

- Practice mindfulness
- Lower your caffeine/alcohol intake and replace it with tea instead.
- Exercising for 5-15 minutes after work.
- Set boundaries if necessary with your boss/co-workers/co-founders and make it clear that you prioritize other things in your life too, not just money!
- Take regular breaks during work even if you don't think you need them!
- If you are going through really challenging times, get a therapist.
- After work, engage in soothing activities such as walking in nature while listening to an audiobook (not work related), etc. and avoid highly stimulating activities such as Gaming, Watching action movies/tv-shows, social media, etc.
- Avoid using your phone/laptop/gadgets 1 hour after waking up and 1-2 hours before sleep.
- Keep your notifications in check.
- Listen to relaxing music/ambient noise during work in order to get into the Flow state easier.
- Educate yourself about mental health!
