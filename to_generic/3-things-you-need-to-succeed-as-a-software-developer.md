# 3 Things You Need to Succeed as a Software Developer

Font: <https://hackernoon.com/what-separates-the-best-devs-from-the-crowd-10-critical-traits>

## Technical Skills

This is the most obvious group. To be a successful developer, you need to be good at your trade: programming languages and frameworks, clean code principles, architecture, testing, debugging, and so on. You also need to be skillful with your tools: version control, command line, and IDE.

## Soft Skills

To be able to work on big, commercial projects, you need a solid set of soft skills: teamwork, communication, project management and planning, remote work, self-organization, learning, personal productivity, and similar.

## Mindset

Mindset is kinda similar to soft skills, but the "skills" itâ€™s comprised of are more fundamental, core traits: curiosity, patience, empathy, grit, adaptability, and so on.

## Why Being Blind to Your Mindset Can Jeopardize Your Career

Without understanding what traits are critical for a programmer and deliberately honing them over time, you'll never reach your full potential. True senior developers know this, are self-aware of their mindset, and continuously work on improving it.

This is the differentiator, the superpower that separates the best developers from the crowd.

Ok, but which traits are the most important? Let's dive a bit deeper into the details.

## 10 Traits of a True Senior Developer

### 1. Curiosity

- Software development
- understand business

### 2. Affinity for Problem-Solving

### 3. Patience

Becoming a true senior developer requires years of deliberate practice.

### 4. Grit (In Just the Right Amount)

But you also need to understand what's the right amount of grit. **What's the sweet spot between unproductively banging your head against the wall for hours and days vs constantly disrupting your team by requesting assistance immediately when you hit even the smallest bump in the road?+**

### 5. Emotional Intelligence

Software development revolves around people and teams. You'll work very closely with your colleagues at an individual level: pair programs, debug together, and review their code.

And your success as a developer depends on how well you can build rapport with them. Without high emotional intelligence, it'll simply be impossible.

### 6. Ability to Keep Your Ego in Check

Your ego will often get hurt in the process. You must be able to keep it in check - but without getting withdrawn and disengaged.

You must be ready to defend your opinion but also know when to let go, to not be a condescending, brilliant jerk.

You need to respect the team, business, and customers. Be able to disagree but commit. And gracefully take constructive (and even purely negative) feedback. Otherwise, you won't be able to effectively work in a team.

### 7. Adaptability

Everything in software development is moving so fast. Technologies are constantly changing. New methodologies get popular. Companies pivot.

### 8. Reliability

I'm repeating it ad nauseam, but software development is a team game. Your colleagues, manager, and company - they all count on you to do your part.

### 9. Pragmatism

Professional software development is an art of tradeoffs. You constantly need to compromise between development speed and quality. Balance new and promising with proven and stable.

To succeed in professional software development, you need to be very pragmatic. You need to understand that nothing is black and white, and that no principle or pattern holds true in every situation.

### 10. Positive Outlook

You'll also work with ugly code. (Yes, every codebase has good and bad parts, even at the top companies like Google.)

If you let negativity take over, if you start criticizing and complaining, you'll not only demotivate yourself, but you'll also kill the morale of your team - which won't take your career very far.

## Bonus: A Few Tips on How to Deliberately Shape Your Mindset

Acknowledge that your mindset is not fixed, and that your traits are malleable.

Build self-awareness. Observe how you react in different situations. Try to understand what makes you feel in a particular way (curious vs bored, positive vs grumpy, eager vs defensive).

Retrospect your behavior from a perspective of a day or two. Was your opinion really pragmatic, or was it your ego talking? How could you have acted differently?

Prepare in advance. Pre-plan up-front how you'll behave next time in a similar situation, and identify the right trigger that will remind you about your plan when the time comes.

Expose yourself to situations that will let you exercise and strengthen desired traits. Actively look for such opportunities.

Focus on a single trait for some time. It will make it easier to find opportunities to exercise it and to increase your self-awareness of this trait.

Reframe. Be conscious and deliberate about how you talk to yourself. The idea isn't stupid, it's surprising. That shiver isn't anxiety, it's excitement. The problem isn't frustrating, it's interesting.

Enlist help. Don't shy from asking your colleague or manager for feedback - or even to become your "accountability partner" who will catch and point out your unwanted behavior.
