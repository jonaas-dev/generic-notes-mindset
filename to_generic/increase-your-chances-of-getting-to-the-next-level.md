# Software Engineering Promotions: Increase Your Chances of Getting to the Next Level 🚀
Font: <https://newsletter.alexhyett.com/p/software-engineering-promotions>

## 🔬 Understand how promotions work at your company

If you are pursuing a promotion it is important that you understand what you are up against so that you can prepare.

## 🤑 Why do you want a promotion?
Money?

At the lower levels, this might include:

- Mentoring others
- Being more active in the technical direction of the product
- Being part of the interview process for new engineers

At the higher end, this will include:

- Being a line manager
- Taking responsibility for deliverables
- Answering the business when deadlines aren't achieved

If your are thinking in money ...

- Starting a side hustle
- Investing
- Switching companies

## 🗺️ Plan for your promotion

Take a look at your current level and work out where you think you stand.

It is important that you are honest with yourself here (BE REALISTIC).

## 💬 Discuss with your manager

Discuss with your manager your goal of being promoted (ONTE-TO-ONE).

## 🥇 Keep a log of your achievements

Such as:

- A presentation you gave to the team
- A new feature that you took the lead on
- A junior engineer that you took under your wing

## 😎 Be realistic when comes to getting a promotion

It is important to be realistic when it comes to progressing your career as a software developer.

## 👋 Get yourself noticed

Consider the following 2 people:

- George - works 100% remotely, is highly skilled, and works exceptionally well.

- Simon - works 2 days in the office, and 3 days at home, is highly skilled, works exceptionally well, and has spoken in person to most of the managers over Friday drinks.

If you are serious about getting a promotion you have to be willing to play the game that others are playing.

## 😊 Be helpful and kind to other people

Life is not a zero-sum game

## 🥸 Fake it to you make it

What would a senior engineer do in your position?

Are there any more responsibilities you can take on?

Can you lend a hand when an issue arises even if it is "not your job"?

## 👎 Promotions aren't guaranteed

If a manager says that your promotion is guaranteed, they are lying.

These are some of the things that could affect your chances of a promotion that are outside of your control.

- 📉 Company performance
- 💼 Stagnant job market
- 🤝 Lack of opportunities
